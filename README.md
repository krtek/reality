# Real Reality

When you want to buy or rent an apparment (house) you do (or should do) research about things that matter to you. Air pollution, parking, public transport availibility (commutation time!), noisiness, places for kids...you name it. But it is unfortunately very time consuming. Until now! Now you've got our beautiful Chrome extension which do all the research for you. Well right now just part of it, but more will come!

Original idea was that Real Reality will be webpage where you can see mashup of real estate offers and interesting data (see above). But it's more work and we want to just show proof of concept before next steps, so we choose to create Chrome extension first (sorry it's not in the Chrome Web Store yet!).

## What to do next? ##

1. web page which aggregates or have real estate offers and enrich them with data we've got (thanks to http://www.iprpraha.cz/)
1. thirdparty widget (like google analytics) which can any webmaster add to it's page with real estate offers.
1. add more enrichments
1. better UI/UX
1. .... your idea ....

## Hacking ##

1. git clone git@github.com:krtek/reality.git
1. install npm
1. npm install  (download all dependencies)
1. npm install -g bower (install bower)
1. bower install
1. gulp watch (or https://gist.github.com/michalbcz/8b0bafbfe17c03d30ebd8cec09acecb4)
1. git commit -m "my new great addition!"
1. git push

Quick and dirty backend source code is [here](https://github.com/bedla/praguehacks-realreality).
Main script is in **/app/scripts.babel/contentscript.js** (this is transpiled from ES6 -> ES5 by babel to placed in /app/scripts directory).
This is quick'n'dirty solution so don't cry please :)
